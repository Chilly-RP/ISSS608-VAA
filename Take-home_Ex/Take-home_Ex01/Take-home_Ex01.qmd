## 0.0 The Task

[Age-sex pyramid](https://isss608-ay2022-23jan.netlify.app/outline/lesson01_outline#age-sex-pyramid) is an analytical visualisation commonly used by demographers to reveal the structure of population by gender and age group. In this take-home exercise, you are required to reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method. Instead of plotting a single age-sex pyramid, however, you are required to display nine selected planning areas on a single view by using [trellis display (also know as small-multiple plot)](https://isss608-ay2022-23jan.netlify.app/outline/lesson01_outline#trellis-display).

## 1.0 Age-sex Pyramid in 9 Selected Area using Trellis Display

### 1.1 Sketch of Proposed Design

For 1 single sheet:

![](/Take-home_Ex/pic/Proposal.png){fig-align="center"}

### 1.2 Clarity

-   **Content:** The proposed design used male and female population, age group and location. We need to calculate the individual population using the total population by ourselves.

-   **X-axis:** It has a duo axis, the population is in the bottom and the percentage of total population for each sex is on the top.

-   **Y-axis:** It shows the different age groups.

-   **Legend:** In the legend I put the percentage of total population.
