In this take-home exercise, you are required to reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method. Instead of plotting a single age-sex pyramid, however, you are required to display nine selected planning areas on a single view by using trellis display (also know as small-multiple plot).\nYou can fund the links to download the dataset below:\nDownload .xls\nDownload .csv"

This shows that the next two decades will usher in an aging society. Second, we can see that in the common resident area, age 60-64 is the primary group which has most population, however in downtown area, age 35-39 are the major group, which represents the people in this aging group earns more."
